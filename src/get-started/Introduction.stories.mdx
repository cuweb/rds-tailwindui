# An Introduction to Raven Design System

Raven Design System, better known as RDS, is Carleton Universityâ€™s design system, is a living digital organism uniting campus wide teams around a common visual language.

Storybook helps you build UI components in isolation from your app's business logic, data, and context.
That makes it easy to develop hard-to-reach states. Save these UI states as **stories** to revisit during development, testing, or QA.

## Getting Started with RDS

Browse example stories now by navigating to them in the sidebar.
View their code in the `stories` directory to learn how they work.
We recommend building UIs with a [**component-driven**](https://componentdriven.org) process starting with atomic components and ending with pages.
